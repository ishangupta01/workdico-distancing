One of the three tools which are part of WorkDiCo, an app service that presents a solution to optimize public places and policies for a post-COVID19 world and to deal with epidemics and disease outbreaks, in general. This tool has also been coded in Python and it uses OpenCV and MobileNET SSD model to detect people in a video frame. It calculates the ditance between all possible sets of two people if it is less than a minimum threshold distance, the people are highlighted in red and it is counted as a violation. The people that are walking alone while maintaining a minimum distance are marked in green.
